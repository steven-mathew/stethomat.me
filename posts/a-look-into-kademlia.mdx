> We describe a peer-to-peer system which has provable consistency and performance in a fault-prone
environment. Our system routes queries and locates
nodes using a novel XOR-based metric topology that
simplifies the algorithm and facilitates our proof.
The topology has the property that every message
exchanged conveys or reinforces useful contact information. The system exploits this information to
send parallel, asynchronous query messages that tolerate node failures without imposing timeout delays
on users.

Even the abstract from the [Kademlia](http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2014/papers/kademlia.pdf) paper
is a lot to digest and I think we can say there's not going to be *any* hand-holding. 
Accordingly, this blog will serve as a collection of my thoughts.

### An overview of the hash table
Firstly, a hash function is a map $h$ such that

$$
h : \{0, 1, ..., u - 1\} \to \{0, 1, ..., m -1\} = K.
$$

for $u < m$. In words, $h$ reduces a universe 
$\mathcal{U}$ with $u$-many keys to $m$-many buckets. 

Next, a *collision* occurs whenever 
$h(k_i) = h(k_j)$
for two keys $k_i \neq k_j \in \mathcal{U}$.
A well-behaved hash function avoids collisions.
Specifically, the authors of Kademlia propose SHA-1
with a keyspace ($\mathcal{U}$ in our model) of 160 bits.

Abstractly, a hashmap $H$ supports $\verb|put|(key, val)$ and 
$\verb|get|(key)$. The former takes a key $k$ and stores value $v$
in bucket $H[h(k)]$ and the latter returns 
$H[h(k)]$. 

The upshot of this datastructure is fantastic
lookup times (constant on average), but sometimes
we need to store **LARGE** values. 
Accordingly, we can store parts of the map
on separate computers. 

A centralized computer, much
like the director of a play, decides which keys
of the hashmap go to which computer. But say
the director decides to quit the play,
we've lost access to the values in our hashmap and 
this map is not particularly resilient.

### What is a distributed hash table anyways?

Enter the distributed hash table. Much like the
traditional hashmap, DHT 
also supports $\verb|put|(key, val)$ and 
$\verb|get|(key)$. But it is fault-tolerant because 
if a computer leaves the network, we can still access 
the map. There are actually some degrees on 
fault-tolerance that I've grazed over (FIXME: 
attach reading on byzantine fault tolerance). 

Now, it would be wonderful if we had a protocol 
that partitions our map to many computers without
a director. This is precisely what Kademlia proposes.

### Where do we go from here?

TODO

In my next blog posts, I'll go over the how and why
of Kademlia.
