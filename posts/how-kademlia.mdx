### What is Kademlia?

Kademlia is a distributed hash table for decentralized peer-to-peer computer networks.

### What is "peer-to-peer"?

Typical networks are based on the client-server model, in which clients make
requests to a service from a centralized server.

Now, a peer-to-peer network contains nodes, or peers, who can share information with 
one another without the need for a centralized server. 

### What's so special about Kademlia nodes?

Let's go over some properties of a node. 
First, they are assigned a 160-bit *opaque* ID. By opaqueness, we mean that
the ID contains information about the node instead of hodgepodge of numbers, 
letters, and symbols.

A node also contains an address. This address is helps other nodes connect
to it in the network and it find other nodes with its third component: 
a routing table.

### Routing tables

A routing table is the data structure which keeps information about
the other nodes to contact. In short:

> The ID tells us **who** this node is,
 the address tells us **where** this node is,
 and the routing table tells us **how** to contact others.
